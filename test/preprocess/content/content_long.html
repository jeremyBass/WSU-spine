			</header>
			<p><big>Unprecedented flexibility</big>&nbsp;is a hallmark of the revised brand standards. For the web, they introduce a new approach to creating websites that can be more customized to individual unit needs while reflecting WSUâ€™s core identity elements.</p>
			<h3>concept</h3>
			<p>The goal is to reflect both the unity and diversity of WSU while providing a positive visitor experience across all University web pages.</p>
			<p>The vertical column or spine seen at the left of this page in desktop view appears on all pages and contains the essential brand, content, and usability essentials.&nbsp;The remainder of the page is essentially a blank canvas awaiting your creativity.</p>
			<p>In addition to the column you&nbsp;<em>see</em>, the Spine is also an&nbsp;<em>unseen</em>&nbsp;skeleton or framework undergirding the page. While the column is more rigid and global, the framework is exceedingly flexible and customizable.&nbsp;The feature list below is a sampling of some of the ways the Spine aims to enable and uphold our unified diversity.</p>
